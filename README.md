    <h1>Privacy Policy â€“ PaintRush</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 2, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy explains how the mobile game <strong>PaintRush</strong>, developed by Anatolian Interactive, handles user data and privacy. The app uses third-party services such as Google AdMob for advertising. No personal information is collected directly by the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>PaintRush does not directly collect any personally identifiable information (such as name, email, location, etc.).</p>
    <p>However, the app integrates third-party advertising services, specifically Google AdMob, which may collect certain data automatically. This data can include device type, advertising ID, and interaction data used for ad targeting and performance analytics.</p>
    <p>To learn more about how Google collects and processes data, please visit: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

    <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
    <p>The game displays banner and interstitial ads provided by Google AdMob. These ads may be personalized based on user interests and behavior as determined by Googleâ€™s algorithms.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>PaintRush may offer optional in-app purchases through Google Play. These transactions are handled entirely by the Google Play billing system. The app itself does not access or store any payment information.</p>

    <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>PaintRush is a casual game designed for general audiences and is not specifically targeted at children under the age of 13.</p>
    <p>The app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. However, since the app uses third-party advertising services such as Google AdMob, some non-personal information (like device identifiers) may be collected automatically by these services, in compliance with their own privacy policies.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information without your consent, please contact us at the email below so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since the app does not collect personal data directly, there is no user data stored on our servers. Any data collected by third-party services is subject to their own privacy and security policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated revision date.</p>
